Movement Data Packet:

The standard PS/2 mouse sends movement/button information to the host using the following 3-byte packet (4): 

        Bit 7      Bit 6      Bit 5      Bit 4      Bit 3    Bit 2      Bit 1     Bit 0 
Byte 1  Y overflow X overflow Y sign bit X sign bit Always 1 Middle Btn Right Btn Left Btn
Byte 2                               X Movement
Byte 3                               Y Movement

Modes of Operation:

Data reporting is handled according to the mode in which the mouse is operating.  There are four standard modes of operation: 

- Reset - The mouse enters Reset mode at power-up or after receiving the "Reset" (0xFF) command. 
- Stream - This is the default mode (after Reset finishes executing) and is the mode in which most software uses the mouse.  If the host has previously set the mouse to Remote mode, it may re-enter Stream mode by sending the "Set Stream Mode" (0xEA) command to the mouse.
- Remote 
- Wrap 

Reset Mode:

The mouse enters reset mode at power-on or in response to the "Reset" (0xFF) command. After entring this mode, the mouse performs a diagnostic self-test referred to as BAT (Basic Assurance Test) and sets the following default values:

Sample Rate = 100 samples/sec
Resolution = 4 counts/mm
Scaling = 1:1
Data Reporting Disabled

It then sends a BAT completion code of either AAh (BAT successful) or FCh (Error). The host's response to a completion code other than AAh is undefined.
Following the BAT completion code (AAh or FCh), the mouse sends its device ID of 00h. This distinguishes it from a keyboard, or a mouse in an extended mode. I have read documents saything the host is not supposed to transmit any data until it receives a device ID.  However I've found that some BIOS's will send the "Reset" command immediately following the 0xAA received after a power-on reset.

After the mouse has sent its device ID to the host, it will enter Stream Mode.  Note that one of the default values set by the mouse is "Data Reporting Disabled".  This means the mouse will not issue any movement data packets until it receives the "Enable Data Reporting" command.

Stream Mode:

In stream mode, the mouse sends movement data when it detects movement or a change in state of one or more mouse buttons. The maximum rate at which this data reporting may occur is known as the sample rate.  This parameter ranges from 10 samples/sec to 200 samples/sec. Its default value is 100 samples/sec and the host may change that value by using the "Set Sample Rate" command.  Stream mode is the default mode of operation following reset.

Remote Mode:

In this mode the mouse reads its inputs and updates its counters/flags at the current sample rate, but it does not automatically issue data packets when movement has occured.  Instead, the host must poll the mouse using the "Read Data" command.  Upon receiving this command the mouse will send a single movement data packet and reset its movement counters.

Command Set:

The following is the set of command accepted by the standard PS/2 mouse.  If the mouse is in Stream mode, the host should disable data reporting (command F5h) before sending any other commands.

FFh (Reset) - The mouse responds to this command with "acknowledge" (FAh) then enters Reset Mode.
FEh (Resend) - The host sends this command whenever it receives invalid data from the mouse. The mouse responds by resending the last(2) packet(3) it sent to the host.   If the mouse responds to the "Resend" command with another invalid packet, the host may either issue another "Resend" command, issue an "Error" command, cycle the mouse's power supply to reset the mouse, or it may inhibit communication (by bringing the Clock line low).  The action taken depends on the host.
F6h (Set Defaults) - The mouse responds with "acknowledge" (FAh) then loads the following values:  Sampling rate = 100, Resolution = 4 counts/mm, Scaling = 1:1, Disable Data Reporting.  The mouse then resets its movement counters and enters stream mode.
F5h (Disable Data Reporting) - The mouse responds with "acknowledge" (FAh) then disables data reporting and resets its movement counters.  This only effects data reporting in Stream mode and does not disable sampling.  Disabled stream mode funcions the same as remote mode.
F4h (Enable Data Reporting) - The mouse responds with "acknowledge" (FAh) then enables data reporting and resets its movement counters.  This command may be issued while the mouse is in Remote Mode (or Stream mode), but it will only effect data reporting in Stream mode.
F3h (Set Sample Rate) - The mouse responds with "acknowledge" (FAh) then reads one more byte from the host.  The mouse saves this byte as the new sample rate. After receiving the sample rate, the mouse again responds with "acknowledge" (0xFA) and resets its movement counters.  Valid sample rates are 10, 20, 40, 60, 80, 100, and 200 samples/sec.
F2h (Get Device ID) - The mouse responds with "acknowledge" (FAh) followed by its device ID (00h for the standard PS/2 mouse.)  The mouse should also reset its movement counters.
F0h (Set Remote Mode) - The mouse responds with "acknowledge" (FAh) then resets its movement counters and enters remote mode.
EEh (Set Wrap Mode) - The mouse responds with "acknowledge" (FAh) then resets its movement counters and  enters wrap mode.
ECh (Reset Wrap Mode) - The mouse responds with "acknowledge" (FAh) then resets its movement counters and enters the mode it was in prior to wrap mode (Stream Mode or Remote Mode.)
EBh (Read Data) - The mouse responds with acknowledge (FAh) then sends a movement data packet. This is the only way to read data in Remote Mode.  After the data packets has been successfully sent, it resets its movement counters.
EAh (Set Stream Mode) - The mouse responds with "acknowledge" then resets its movement counters and enters steram mode.
E9h (Status Request) - The mouse responds with "acknowledge" then sends the following 3-byte status packet (then resets its movement counters.): 

       Bit 7     Bit 6 Bit 5  Bit 4   Bit 3    Bit 2    Bit 1      Bit 0
Byte 1 Always 0  Mode  Enable Scaling Always 0 Left Btn Middle Btn Right Btn
Byte 2                               Resolution
Byte 3                              Sample Rate

Right, Middle, Left Btn = 1 if button pressed; 0 if button is not pressed.
Scaling = 1 if scaling is 2:1; 0 if scaling is 1:1. (See commands E7h and E6h)
Enable = 1 if data reporting is enabled; 0 if data reporting is disabled. (See commands F5h and F4h)
Mode = 1 if Remote Mode is enabled; 0 if Stream mode is enabled. (See commands F0h and EAh)

E8h (Set Resolution) - The mouse responds with acknowledge (FAh) then reads one byte from the host and again responds with acknowledge (FAh) then resets its movement counters.  The byte read from the host determines the resolution as follows: 
 
Byte Read from Host  Resolution
0x00                 1 count/mm
0x01                 2 count/mm
0x02                 4 count/mm
0x03                 8 count/mm

E7h (Set Scaling 2:1) - The mouse responds with acknowledge (FAh) then enables 2:1 scaling
E6h (Set Scaling 1:1) - The mouse responds with acknowledge (FAh) then enables 1:1 scaling

The only commands the standard PS/2 mouse will send to the host are the "Resend" (FEh) and "Error" (FCh).  They both work the same as they do as host-to-device commands.

Intellimouse Extensions:

After power-on or reset the Microsoft Intellimouse operates just like a standard PS/2 mouse (ie, it uses a 3-byte movement data packet, responds to all commands in the same way as a standard PS/2 mouse, and reports a device ID of 00h.)  To enter "scrolling wheel" mode, the host sends the following command sequence:

Set sample rate 200
Set sample rate 100
Set sample rate 80

The host then issues the "Get device ID" command and waits for a response.  If a standard PS/2 mouse (ie, non-Intellimouse) is attached, it will respond with a device ID of 00h.  In this case, the host will recognize the fact that the mouse does have a scrolling wheel and will continue to treat it as a standard PS/2 mouse.  However, if a Microsoft Intellimouse is attached, it will respond with an ID of 03h.  This tells the host that the attached pointing device has a scrolling wheel and the host will then expect the mouse to use the following 4-byte movement data packet: 

        Bit 7      Bit 6      Bit 5      Bit 4      Bit 3    Bit 2      Bit 1     Bit 0 
Byte 1  Y overflow X overflow Y sign bit X sign bit Always 1 Middle Btn Right Btn Left Btn
Byte 2                               X Movement
Byte 3                               Y Movement
Byte 4                               Z Movement

Z Movement is a 2's complement number that represents the scrolling wheel's movement since the last data report.  Valid values are in the range of -8 to +7. This means the number is actually represented only by the least significant four bits.

/*
The PS/2 Mouse/Keyboard Protocol
http://www.computer-engineering.org/ps2protocol/

Host-to-Device Communication:

PS/2 device always generates the clock signal. If the host wants to send data, it must first put the Clock
and Data lines in a "Request-to-send" state as follows:

* Inhibit communication by pulling Clock low for at least 100 microseconds.
* Apply "Request-to-send" by pulling Data low, then release Clock.

The device should check for this state at intervals not to exceed 10 milliseconds. When the device detects this state, it will begin generating Clock signals and clock in eight data bits and one stop bit. The host changes the Data line only when the Clock line is low, and data is read by the device when Clock is high.

After the stop bit is received, the device will acknowledge the received byte by bringing the Data line low and generating one last clock pulse. 

Steps the host must follow to send data to a PS/2 device:
 1) Bring the Clock line low for at least 100 microseconds.
 2) Bring the Data line low.
 3) Release the Clock line.
 4) Wait for the device to bring the Clock line low.
 5) Set/reset the Data line to send the first data bit
 6) Wait for the device to bring Clock high.
 7) Wait for the device to bring Clock low.
 8) Repeat steps 5-7 for the other seven data bits and the parity bit
 9) Release the Data line.
 10) Wait for the device to bring Data low.
 11) Wait for the device to bring Clock low.
 12) Wait for the device to release Data and Clock
